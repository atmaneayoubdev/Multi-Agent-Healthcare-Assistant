## 📌 Overview <a name="overview"></a>

The **Multi-Agent Medical Assistant** is an **AI-powered chatbot** designed to assist with **medical diagnosis, research, and patient interactions**.  

🚀 **Powered by Multi-Agent Intelligence**, this system integrates:  
- **🤖 Large Language Models (LLMs)**  
- **🖼️ Computer Vision Models** for medical imaging analysis  
- **📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** leveraging vector databases  
- **🌐 Real-time Web Search** for up-to-date medical insights  
- **👨‍⚕️ Human-in-the-Loop Validation** to verify AI-based medical image diagnoses  

### **What You’ll Learn from This Project** 📖  
🔹 **👨‍💻 Multi-Agent Orchestration** with structured graph workflows  
🔹 **🔍 Advanced RAG Techniques** – hybrid retrieval, semantic chunking, and vector search  
🔹 **⚡ Confidence-Based Routing** & **Agent-to-Agent Handoff**  
🔹 **🔒 Scalable, Production-Ready AI with Modularized Code & Robust Exception Handling**  

📂 **For learners**: Check out [`agents/README.md`](agents/README.md) for a **detailed breakdown** of the agentic workflow! 🎯
